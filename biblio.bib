              have prevented its broad application. Here we describe Drop-seq,
              a strategy for quickly profiling thousands of individual cells by
              separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous droplets,
              associating a different barcode with each cell's RNAs, and
              sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts
              from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while
              remembering transcripts' cell of origin. We analyzed
              transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39
              transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular
              atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel
              candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq will accelerate biological
              discovery by enabling routine transcriptional profiling at

               Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good,
               as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by
               identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone
               network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of
               118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy
